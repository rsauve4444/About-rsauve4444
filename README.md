Working 40+ years in Internet & Telecom, I have dabbled in html, JavaScript, perl, C, Java, python & rust.
Most experience is with JavaScript, perl & python.
Also have spent inordinate amounts of time debugging other people's PHP ( mostly after version upgades)

I do not consider myself a programmer, more a duffer who learns how to use various hammers and then proceeds to bang nails, screws, staples and bolts in.
       So please excuse ugly code that works . . .
